## Classes And Objects

### What are classes 

    In TypeScript, classes are blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data (properties) and behavior (methods) into a single unit. By defining classes, you can organize your code, promote reusability, and enhance readability.

### Key Components Involves 

    - Methods: Functions defined within a class that perform specific actions.
    
    - Constructors: Special methods called when an object is created from a class. Constructors initialize class properties.
    
    - Properties: Variables associated with a class instance.
    
    - Inheritance: The ability to create new classes based on existing ones, allowing code reuse and specialization.


### Objects in Typescript

    - Objects An object is an instance of class which contains set of key value pairs. It's value may be scalar values or functions or even array of other objects. 

### Difference Btw Extends and Implements

    - The extends keyword is used for two main purposes in TypeScript: inheriting from a class (class inheritance) and extending a type (type extension).

    - The implements keyword is used to ensure that a class conforms to a particular interface. This enforces that the class implements all the properties and methods defined by the interface.
